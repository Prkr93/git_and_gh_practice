Growing up, my family had a condo in Gatlinburg, TN, and I enjoyed the times that we'd go up there once a year and spend a week as a family. My favorite travel experience would have to be when I hiked Mt Belford with Ming a couple of years ago. Absolutely beautiful, two day hike and the coolest 14er hike, or otherwise, that I've ever done. Was able to follow the river most of the way so we had access to fresh enough water, which made our packs very manageable. Been wanting to go back ever since I left.
