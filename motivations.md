The biggest motivator in my life for me is my health. I've been working a bunch of jobs that just wanted to work me to death, and as someone with a chronic health condition, that wasn't healthy in any way for me. While working these jobs, I was faced with impossible problems like how to staff a Dunkin for 5 positions when you only have 2-3 crew available to you, if you're lucky. Then, anything that falls through the cracks is up to you, and you're just told to deal with it. This, I guess, is how I am dealing with it. I've moved somewhere I want to be, where I can be healthy, and proceeding back into a career that I found fulfillment and joy in, but with a much more solid foundation.
